The Greene King brewery sits alongside the historic ruins of the Abbey and to this day our brewers still draw water from the same chalk wells used by their brewing predecessors all those years ago.\r\nHailed by the late beer writer Michael Jackson as \"one of the great characters of the beer world\", Abbot Ale is brewed for quality of the highest order. Abbot is an irresistible ale with masses of fruit characters, a malty richness and superb hop balance. It is brewed longer to a unique recipe, which makes it the full-flavoured, smooth and mature beer it is today.",

This beer is a Best Bitter that is showcasing mid-range drinkability with a well-balanced malt and hop character. We used Marris Otter and Victory malts giving this a traditional biscuit-y malt flavor. We then used traditional Golding and Fuggle UK hops which are earthier than their American counterparts. We then dry hopped using Australian Helga hops which are known for their delicate herbal notes. She was then all topped off with a British yeast.",

      "description":"Brooklyn Summer Ale is a modern rendition of the \"Light Dinner Ales\" brewed in England throughout the 1800's right up until the 1940's. They were also called \"luncheon ales\" or even \"family ales\", because they were refreshing and flavorful without being too heavy. We brew our Brooklyn Summer Ale from premium English barley malt, which gives this light-bodied golden beer a fresh bready flavor. German and American hops lend a light crisp bitterness and a citrus\/floral aroma, resulting in a beer with a very sunny disposition.",

Due to the positive reaction it received and thinking how ideal it would be as a summer tipple, Head Brewer Cormac O\u2019Dwyer decided to release a bottled version as the \u2018Brewer\u2019s Select\u2019 summer beer for 2012.\r\nTraditionally, English bitters are made with the very hard water profile which occurs at Burton-on-Trent, the home of brewing in England. In West Waterford, the hard water profile means flavours of the English bitter style can be replicated. Coupled with this, the beer is hopped solely with Challenger hops, an English hop used in many traditional bitters. At 3.8%, this is an easy-drinking beer that will be perfect for summer barbeque days!",
