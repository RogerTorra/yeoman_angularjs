            "description": "Abbot Ale is brewed in Bury St. Edmunds – a place which enjoys a rich brewing heritage than can be traced back almost 1000 years.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe famous Domesday Book includes a passage about 'cerevisiarii' or ale brewers as servants of the Abbot in Bury St Edmunds' Great Abbey. The Greene King brewery sits alongside the historic ruins of the Abbey and to this day our brewers still draw water from the same chalk wells used by their brewing predecessors all those years ago.\r\nHailed by the late beer writer Michael Jackson as \"one of the great characters of the beer world\", Abbot Ale is brewed for quality of the highest order. Abbot is an irresistible ale with masses of fruit characters, a malty richness and superb hop balance. It is brewed longer to a unique recipe, which makes it the full-flavoured, smooth and mature beer it is today.",

We first used Nelson Sauvin hops in our Celebratory Ale, William Godell, in 2009. We love the green citrus aromas that this hop provides.\r\n\r\nThis hop variety is grown on New Zealand’s South Island and it adds fantastic gooseberry flavours to the beer similar to a Sauvignon Blanc. New Zealand has been producing some fantastic hop varieties for many years but the aroma of Nelson Sauvin is truly unique in the hop world.”",

We use the finest British malts and hops to produce a beer that’s as true to style as anything from across the pond.    We kept the alcohol moderate  at about 4.75% by volume so this fine ale could be enjoyed responsibly.  This great traditional ale is amazing on its own and even more amazing when paired with food.",
