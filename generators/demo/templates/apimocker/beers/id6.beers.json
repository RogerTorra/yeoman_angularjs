            "description": "Sit back during Colorado’s other seasons and enjoy the anticipation of summer days on their way with our American version of an English-style Summer Ale. Bridging the gap between the warm, rich ales of winter and the light and refreshing brews of summer, Almost-Summer Ale is a delicious balance of biscuity-malt flavor and light citrus hop finish, with a slightly bigger body and smoother mouth feel than a traditional summer ale. Note the sunny golden hue, take a moment to enjoy the balanced aromas of both citrusy hops and malts. Perfect for enjoying the Colorado days where chilly mornings turn into sunny afternoons. Cheers!",

Now, if those bright hop notes of apricot, melon, and stone fruit aren’t quite enough for you, we have added Pilsner malt for a crisp clean mouth feel. And to finish brewing Almost Summer, a precisely measured amount of caramel malt was added for some sunny sweetness…so, don’t forget the sunscreen!",

Slightly sweet and creamy; perfect for the session connoisseur and the timid domestic drinker looking for an introductory craft beer. \r\n\r\nThis brew was made to please the novice craft beer drinker. Dubbed the \"domestic with a kick\" it provides a smooth, pleasant flavor throughout. More flavorful than your domestic beers, but light enough that anyone can enjoy.",

It may derive from the word \"Hoppen\" an Old English word for dancing or funfair. It has even been suggested that people \"hopped\" about itching due to fleas caught from animals that travelled with the fair. However, we’d like to think it may relate to the quality hops used in the brewing of our famous beer. Enjoy Newcastle Summer Ale at the fair or wherever you are this summer.",

Available on tap and in 16oz cans from May – August, the Summer Ale is too good to miss! \r\n\r\nQuality Supreme: Narragansett Summer is a light session ale made with two row pale malt and citra hops. The citra hops are a very popular, newer variety that deliver aromas of citrus and passion fruit without overpowering the taste buds. The beer is blonde in color and the mild kiss of the hops complement the pale malt perfectly, making it extremely drinkable. The draft is brewed in small batches at Trinity Brew House in Providence and Cottrell Brewery in Pawcatuck, CT, and the tall boy cans are brewed at High Falls Brewery in Rochester, NY.

                "description": "English Summer Ale is light straw to golden colored with medium-low to medium bitterness, light to medium-light body, and low to medium residual malt sweetness. Torrefied and/or malted wheat are often used in quantities of 25% or less. Malt flavor may be biscuit-like. English, American or Noble-type hop, character, flavor and aroma are evident and may or may not be assertive yet always well balanced with malt character. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions. In bottled versions, normal or lively carbon dioxide content is appropriate. The overall impression is refreshing and thirst quenching. Fruity-ester characters are acceptable at low to moderate levels. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",
