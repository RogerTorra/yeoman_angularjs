Once you get to know MacBubba, you won’t know how you went anywhere without him. This Scotch Ale has a subtle smoky undertone not found in many other beers. Starting with a beautiful dark-amber color it has a nice rich aroma that follows with a full bodied caramel flavor. You will note a\r\nslight “peaty” character in the finish, derived from the addition of some of the finest Peated Malt from Scotland. We think you will find this Scotch Ale very easy to enjoy while still bold enough to stand up to a harsh winter chill.",

Scottish Style Ale is our interpretation of the robust brews native to Scotland. Generous quantities of Pale malt along with Munich and Caramalts give this ale a deep and complex profile. Scottish Style Ale is just a shade darker than our Bitter, with a rich, slightly sweet first impression on the palate that rounds out to a satisfying maltiness and a medium-dry hop finish. At 6.3% ABV it's hearty but not overwhelming. Sure to please the Braveheart in all of us.",

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).
