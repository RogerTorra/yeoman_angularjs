Into the lab we went, coming out with a modern-day British-style India pale ale that stands proud of its hoppy heritage.",

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.",

The Rabbit Hole Brewing 10/6 English IPA features a prominent English hop character supported by a smooth, bready malt backbone. This Rabbit Hole Ale is crafted with the finest floor-malted Maris Otter winter barley and flavored with three different varieties of English hops. It is bold and flavorful without driving your palate completely insane. So whatever the time may be, it is always time for another 10/6, the IPA with refinement.",

To balance out all this hoppy goodness we’ve added Rye, plus some Pale Ale and Cara Malt, to imbue sweetness, body and balance as well as some lovely subtle toffee flavours. Want to know more? The recipe for our Rye IPA was created by Adnams brewer (and certified hop freak) Belinda, who was excited to be able to let her passion for American craft beers shine through in this flavoursome brew. Jack Brand Rye IPA is available for a limited time in 30L kegs in selected outlets. Food Matches Pair our Rye IPA with spicy Mexican dishes or hot Caribbean flavours.",

            "description": "The California Gold Rush lured thousands west to \"see the elephant,\" a 19th-century metaphor for the hopeful but risky pursuit of happiness, adventure, and fortune. As early as 1849, India Pale Ale - prepared by British brewers for export to India by adding dry hops to barrels of hoppy ale - was also heading west, from England around the Horn to San Francisco. Thirsty ‘49ers savored the best imported IPAs, but it wasn’t until 1975 that Anchor, Americas' original craft brewery, pioneered the revival of dry-hopped handmade ales. Now, that tradition fast-forwards to an adventurous new brew: Anchor IPA™.\r\n\r\nAnchor IPA™ is made with 2-row barley malt and fresh whole-cone hops, its bright amber color, distinctively complex aroma, spiky bitterness, malty depth, and clean finish unite to create a uniquely flavorful, memorable, and timeless craft IPA.\r\n\r\nThe elephant you see on Anchor IPA™ was hand-drawn by our label artist, James Stitt. To \"see the elephant\" was a popular 19th-century expression that originated with a tale that predates the California Gold Rush.\r\n\r\nThere once lived a farmer who had heard of elephants but had never seen one. He longed for the day when he might catch a glimpse of this rare, exotic creature. When the circus came to town, he loaded his wagon with fresh produce and headed to market. On the way, just as he'd hoped, he came across the circus parade, nobly led by an enormous elephant. The farmer was ecstatic, but his horses were terrified. They reared and bucked, overturning his wagon and scattering its precious contents in the road. \"I don’t give a hoot,\" exclaimed the farmer. \"I have seen the elephant!\"\r\n\r\nThe elephant became the universal symbol of the Gold Rush, as evidenced by the journals, letters, and sketchbooks of the forty-niners. Whether or not they struck it rich in the diggings, those plucky pioneers would forever treasure their California adventure as the defining moment of their lives. Have you seen the elephant?",

We add minerals to the Southampton water to make it identical to the water in Burton-on-Trent, notably a fair amount of calcium. The high mineral content has the effect of adding a dryness of flavor to the brew as well as a fullness of body. It has a light/medium malt flavor and a refreshing fruitiness (notes of “peach” and “apricot”), the hop character is also restrained compared to other traditional English styles such as IPA.",

It boasts the fine wallop of hops that craft beer lovers have come to expect, and maintains a fine balance between bitterness, malt, and alcohol.  We think you will find its floral aroma, its hoppy bite, and its high gravity to be a warmly satisfying experience.  \r\n\r\nDouble Pale is manufactured from 100% organic ingredient; including hops from both the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand.  After a protracted kettle, this fine ale is allowed to ferment to full attenuation.  A final dry-hopping before packaging reinforces its floral character.",

            "description": "An English IPA brewed with all English specialty malts, hops and yeast.  This is a crisp, clean IPA featuring the woodsy, spicy, and fruity flavors of Fuggles and East Kent Golding hops.\r\n\r\nBefore opening Arbor Brewing Company in 1995, founders Matt & Rene Greff went on a “fact finding” trip to England and Ireland and fell under the spell of English ales.  Like old world wines that value terroir over the bigger flashier palates of their American counterparts, English ales tend toward a subtle sophistication and shine a soft spotlight on earthy old-world hop varietals.  The Fuggles and Goldings is sort of a tribute beer paying homage to this tradition.",

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.",

Malt is subdued but provides enough heft to balance the hops. Long crisp clean dry finish.\r\n\r\nFirst brewed to commemorate our 1600th batch, the HXL is a full-flavored, high gravity version of our Huxell. We used twice as much malted barley to hike the ABV to 7.5% and added boatloads of Centennial hops for a lasting tangy bitterness.",
