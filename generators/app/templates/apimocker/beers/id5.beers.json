The beer is meant to be a little bitter, but not over the top and very drinkable. The hop aroma and flavor do not dominate the beer, but support the malt to create a well balanced beer.",

This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800 s. Dry hopping during fermentation creates a floral nose with a hint of pepper and spicy, subtle undertones. 2° Below provides a bright, hoppy palate and a cheery warm afterglow.",

            "description": "Many times we've heard, more is not always better. Chainsaw is a connoisseur version of our awrd-winning Sawtooth Ale, designed to befuddle silly generalizations about life. This Double ESB pours a brilliant deep ruby amber with a rocky near white head. The nose opens with bright spicy and herbal hops, with hints of dried fruit and port. The flavor starts with a chewy, bready malt and hints of brulee and kola nut that are suddenly swept away by thyme-like and hoppy bitterness. The strong herbal flavors then give way to a dry finish of licorice, gentian, and Italian bitters. We hope you enjoy!",

Both Burton Bridge Brewery directors, Geoff Mumford & Bruce Wilkinson were involved with the original beer at Ind Coope and felt it important that the beer returned to it’s Burton home. It has been agreed to run a trial brew to have it’s debut at the Burton CAMRA Beer Festival in March 2015. It would be impossible to brew an exact replica of the original, but we intend to get it as close as possible. Hops used are known only to a few and will not be revealed here.",

With its middle-of-the-road finish and its moderate strength, this is the perfect session beer. The overall impression is of a golden, moderately malty ale with medium hop flavor and bitterness.
