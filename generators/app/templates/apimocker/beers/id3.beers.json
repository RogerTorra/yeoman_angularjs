            "description": "The distinctive hop character of our 5 Barrel Pale Ale is due to the extraction of essential oils from select hops. We treat 5 Barrel Pale Ale to an infusion of fresh whole hop flowers in the Hop Back and the Fermentor, as well as four hop additions during the kettle boil. We like how this gives the beer a fresh, lively flavor and aroma.",

Our take on the style is suitably sessionable at a modest 4% abv, but we wanted to turn it up a notch in the hop department – so instead of using the mellower English hop varieties we blasted it with a blend of Centennial and Chinook in the kettle, followed by a hefty dry hop with more Centennial.

We sprinkle warm water over the Old Foghorn mash after the first “wort” has run off, creating a second, lighter brew. Technically, both beers are \"ales\" because they are made with top-fermenting yeast. Like its forebears, the result is an easy-drinking “session” beer.\r\n\r\nFor hundreds of years, the term \"small beer\" was used in English to describe the lighter, less expensive counterpart to barleywine. In our revival of this ancient tradition, Anchor Small® Beer is resourcefulness at its best – beer begets beer.",

Bock means billy goat in German and Leinenkugel's Big Butt Doppelbock's name and label pokes fun at the goat's springtime mating ritual. The result is a malty, rich, full-bodied bock beer brewed with two-and six-row pale and specialty malts and two specialty hops. Like all Leinie's beers, Big Butt Doppelbock is handcrafted one batch at a time in our historic Chippewa Falls brewery.",

Brooklyn Pennant Ale is a honey-colored pale ale with a brisk malt palate and finely balanced hop character. Pennant is a traditional English-style pale ale. The pale ale style developed in the early 19th century, and was called “pale” because it appeared so in comparison to the darker ale styles of the day (East India Pale Ale was a stronger, paler, more bitter version of the style). Brooklyn Pennant Ale is brewed from Scottish Maris Otter malt, which is justly prized for its toasty, biscuity flavor and the round smoothness it imparts to beer. Our house ale yeast brings out an appetizing fruitiness and ferments to a dry finish. During 2005, Brooklyn Brewery will donate one dollar from every case of Pennant sold to the funding of the statue of Brooklyn Dodgers greats Jackie Robinson and Pee-Wee Reese planned for the Cyclones ballpark in Coney Island.",

Dan flew in yeast from England and chose premium British Maris Otter Pale Malt to be balance the classic English Golding Hops from East Kent. \r\n\r\nYou can expect to pour a lightly carbonated glass of rich amber ale, slightly cloudy and soft on the pallet with a pronounced dry hopped finish. \r\n\r\nSummer's end is fleeting here in Wisconsin so enjoy it while you may, before long both summer and our ale will be gone. So slow down, relax and savor the season.",
