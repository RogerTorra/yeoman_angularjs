But we just think it’s a right good pint.\r\nExtra Smooth is available in draught at the pub or in cans to be enjoyed at home (both 3.6% ABV).\r\nPlus you can also get John Smith’s Extra Cold on draught; the same great taste, but colder, we don't muck about with names see.",

Various maltings of two-row barley are joined with American Glacier hops to give this beer its color, complexity, and a bit of a New World twist. The Old World character present in this ale is largely influenced by its yeast, which originates in the port city of Hull, East Yorkshire, England. McNellie’s Pub Ale pairs excellent with fish & chips (of course), Roast Beef, Steak, Pork, Grilled Chicken, and Barbeque.",

This best bitter is brewed with British Malt, Yeast and Hops, with London water, passion and heritage.\r\n\r\nHistory: The tradition of electing a ‘Mayor of Garratt’ evolved only a stones throw away from our brewery during the early 18th century. These popular mock elections, which attracted huge crowds, were held at the same time as elections to Parliament. They centred upon our local pubs, The Leather Bottle and Old Sergeant. The candidates were, typically, unconventional colourful characters from London who adopted comic names and made witty speeches. The event provided a platform for free speech, a protest against the ruling classes and of course, mandatory drunken revelry! This beer is a nod to this truly original eccentric English tradition.",

                "description": "Special bitter is more robust than ordinary bitter. It has medium body and medium residual malt sweetness. It is deep gold to copper colored. Hop bitterness should be medium and absent of harshness. Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",
